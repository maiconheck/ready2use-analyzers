# Ready2Use Analyzers
A well configured and opinionated [ruleset files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/using-rule-sets-to-group-code-analysis-rules?view=vs-2017#rule-set-format) from a curated selection of Roslyn diagnostic analyzers.

There are excellent code analyzers available for .NET through the Rosilyn platform. ðŸ˜ƒ But finding them, and selecting their rules, is not a very fun task! ðŸ˜•

## The included analyzers

These preset configurations contains **600+** analyses rules of:

* [StyleCop](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers)
* [FxCop](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers)
* [Code Cracker](https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker)
* [Roslynator](https://github.com/JosefPihrt/Roslynator)

## Getting Started
1. Install the packages below to the projects do you wish to analyze **(usually all)** on your solution:

```
dotnet add package StyleCop.Analyzers
dotnet add package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers
dotnet add package CodeCracker.CSharp
dotnet add package Roslynator.Analyzers
```

OR add the Package References to the *.csproj files

```
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers" Version="2.9.8">
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    
    <PackageReference Include="StyleCop.Analyzers" Version="1.1.118">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    
    <PackageReference Include="Roslynator.Analyzers" Version="2.3.0">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
	
	<PackageReference Include="CodeCracker.CSharp" Version="1.1.0">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>
```

2. Clone this repo and copy the `Analyzers` folder to your root solution folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/maiconheck/ready2use-analyzers.git
or
git clone git@github.com:maiconheck/ready2use-analyzers.git
```

3. For each project that do you have installed the packages, edit the `.csproj` file and add the line below accordingly the project kind:

>For **distribution libraries projects**, or any project that you want to get the most analyzes (including documentation ones)
use the **All.ruleset**:

On **PropertyGroup** section add:
```XML
<CodeAnalysisRuleSet>..\Analyzers\All.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
```

>For **most projects** use the **Default.ruleset**. This ruleset include all rules of the **All.ruleset** except the documentation ones:

On **PropertyGroup** section add:
```XML
<CodeAnalysisRuleSet>..\Analyzers\Default.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
```

>For **unit and integration tests** use the **Test.ruleset**. This ruleset include all rules of the **Default.ruleset** except some rules about naming and explicit type declaration (like `MakeLocalVariableConstWhenItIsPossibleAnalyzer` and `AlwaysUseVarAnalyzer`):

On **PropertyGroup** section add:
```XML
<CodeAnalysisRuleSet>..\Analyzers\Test.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
```

4. Clean and build the solution:
```
dotnet clean
dotnet build
```

5. Fix the warnings / errors and have a much better code! ðŸ˜ƒ
Do not worry if you receive too many warnings / errors. There are **600+** validations! Correct them step by step. I suggest organizing them into groups and fixing one group at a time.

>ðŸ‘Œ Feel free to disable rules that don't apply to your context or project.

Almost all analyzers have the action set to 'error' rather than 'warning'. I strongly recommend that you use them that way.

That way, you make sure that the rules are respected, because otherwise the projects will not compile!
Keep them at Warning level (eg, <Rule Id="CC0018 "Action=**"Warning"** />) besides not guarantee this, usually makes Warnings increase, 
because warnings are often not noticed and may be forgotten, or "postponed."

So once you've corrected all the diagnostics reported by the analyzers, you'll ensure that no one push code with more diagnostic issues.
And even if someone does, the build will break on the CI (if you have one)

Finally, fixing issues at the time they occur is much more comfortable (and practical) than having to do it all at once if they pile up.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips
If you want all diagnostic issues (without exception) to be treated as errors, you can add `TreatWarningsAsErrors` property to the .csproj wished file(s):
```XML
<PropertyGroup>    
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
</PropertyGroup>
```

* Consider exceptions to rules. There are specific cases where some rules will not apply. In that case, you should [suppress the message](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/visualstudio/code-quality/in-source-suppression-overview?view=vs-2017#global-suppression-file). Example using a [global suppression file](https://github.com/maiconheck/shared-kernel/blob/master/src/SharedKernel/GlobalSuppressions.cs).

Other approach is to disable the rule on `NoWarn` property on the .csproj wished file(s):
```XML
<NoWarn>CA1716,AD0001</NoWarn>
```

Another useful property is the `WarningsNotAsErrors` that overrides the error behavior for warning in one or more specified rules:
```XML
<WarningsNotAsErrors>RCS1202</WarningsNotAsErrors>
```
